# E-Bag
Entire framework of E Bag along with the back end code is present in this repository.

This is an algorithm based on parallel processing in arduino. The optimum usage of every iteration of arduino is made to contribute towanrds some task in the bag. Think of microcontroller as a large national highway, we can either make the entire highway into single lane or divide it into small sub lanes. The traditional pattern of arduino coding is using two loops, void setup and void loop, in the following code you will be able to see a novel way of running arduino codes itself solely using the millis functions. The millis functions is extremely accurate and simply by using a slightly different architecture we are able to use aprallel processing in arduino.
